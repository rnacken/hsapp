# Hsapp

This project will be a simple clone of the Blizzard game Hearthstone. This will be meant as a showcase for my Angular (4) skills. The design and layout will be based on Google's Material design standards.

Currently, the project is not in Beta yet. I'm working on connecting Firebase to the app, to allow for 2 player connections.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

No tests available right now
Later:
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

No tests available right now
Later:
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
